# How to read this book

This material was divided in two big parts. The first one approaches the most basic points of Docker. It is the exactly minimum necessary that a developer needs to know to use this technology properly, that is, knowing what happens exactly when executing each command.

In this first part, we will try not to approach the “low level” issues of Docker, because they are more appealing for the infrastructure team. 

In case you don’t know anything about Docker, we **strongly** advise you to read this first part, so you can go through the next part that focus on building a web application on Docker following the best practices, no pauses. In this book, we used the practices from [12factor](https://12factor.net).

The **12 factor** will be detailed in the beginning of the second part, but we can tell what we consider the “12 commandments for web applications on Docker”, that is, once your application follows all the good practices presented in this document, you will be possibly using Docker at its full potential. 
This second part is divided by each good practice of **12factor**. Therefore, we present a sample code in the first chapter that will evolve while the book develops. The idea is that you can practice with a real code, thus absorbing the content in a practical way. We also put together some appendices with extra-important subjects that don’t fit in the following chapters.
