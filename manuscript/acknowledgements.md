# Acknowledgements
My first thanks go to the person who gave me the chance of being here and to be able to write this book: my mother. The famous Cigana, or Dona Arlete, a wonderful person and a role model. 
I want also thank to my second mother, Dona Maria, who took so much care of me when I was a kid while Dona Arlete was taking care of her two other kids and a nephew. I feel lucky for having two moms while many don’t have one.  
I take this chance to thanks the person who introduced Docker to me, [Robinho](https://twitter.com/robinhopeixoto), also known as Robson Peixoto. In a conversation during the Linguágil meeting, in Salvador, Bahia, he told me: “Study Docker!” And here I am finishing a book that transformed my life. I truly thank you, Robinho!
Thanks to Luís Armando Bianchin, who started to write along with me but was not able to go on for other reasons. I’m very grateful, for your constant feedback kept me going on writing this book.
Thanks to Paulo Caroli who encouraged me to write the book and introduced me to the Leanpub platform. If it wasn’t for him, this book would not be here so quick.Thanks to the amazing [Emma Pinheiro](https://twitter.com/n3k00n3), for the beautiful cover. I also want to thanks a lot the incredible people from  [Raul Hacker Club](http://raulhc.cc/), who have strongly encouraged me this whole time. 
Thanks for the mother of my son, Eriane Soares, who is an amazing friend of mine and have encouraged me to write the book while we were still living together!
As every open knowledge product, this book wouldn’t be possible without the help of the vibrant Docker Brazil community. I will highlight the effort of some members of reading several chapters many times and dedicating their precious time and suggesting improvements:
