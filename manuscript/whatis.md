# What is Docker?

In a very summarised way, we can say that Docker is an open platform, created with the goal of facilitating the development, deployment and execution of applications in isolated environments. It was designed especially to make an application available in the fastest way as possible.

 Using Docker, you can easily manage the application infrastructure, speeding up the process of creation, maintenance and modification of your service. The process occurs without the need of any privileged access to the corporate infrastructure. Therefore, the team responsible for the application can take part in the environment specification along with the team responsible for the servers. Docker provided a common “language” between developers and servers administrators. This new “language” is used to build files with the definitions of the required infrastructure and to show how the application will be arranged in this environment, which port will provide the service, which data from external volumes will be requested and other possible requests. Docker also provides a public cloud to share ready environments, that can be used to enable customizations for specific environments. It is possible to get a ready image from apache and configure the specific requested modules to the applications, thus creating your own customised environment. All with a few source lines of code. 
Docker uses the container model to “package” the application that, after being transformed into a Docker imagem, can be reproduced in a platform of any size; that is, in case the application runs flawlessly in your notebook, it will behave the same in the server ou mainframe. Build once, and execute wherever you want. 
Containers are isolated on disk, memory, processing and network levels. This separation provides great flexibility, in which distinct environments can co-exist in the same host without any issues. It is worth to highlight that the overhead in this process is the minimum necessary, because each container usually carries only one process, that is responsible for delivering the desired service. In any case, this container also carries every file needed (configuration, library and related) for a complete isolated execution.  Another interesting point on Docker is the velocity to make the desired environment feasible; as it is basically the beginning of a process and not a whole operational system, the availability time is usually counted in seconds. ### Virtualization at operational system level The isolation model in Docker is the virtualization at operational system level, a virtualization method in which the kernel of the operational system allows that multiples processes are executed separately in the same host. These running isolated processes are called containers. ![](images/docker2.png)

To create the required isolation in the process, Docker uses the kernel functionality, called [namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html), that creates isolated environments between containers: the processes of a running application will not have access to the resources of another one. Unless it is expressly enabled in the configuration of each environment. 
To avoid the exhaustion of machine resources due to one isolated environment, Docker uses the [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) feature from kernel. This makes possible the coexistence os different containers in the same host, without one affecting the other for overusing shared resources.
